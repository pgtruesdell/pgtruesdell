### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with more than a decade of experience working with small and medium-sized businesses to develop practical solutions. I am currently working at Fixed Cost Financial, building a more straightforward, more honest and transparent, and affordable way to invest your money and get advice. In my free time, I am working on CartaCRM as well as other miscellaneous pet projects.
